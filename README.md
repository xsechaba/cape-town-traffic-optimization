### **2. Route Planner Demo (60 seconds)**
**Navigate to**: Route Planner tab
**Demo Steps**:
1. Select "Cape Town International Airport" → "V&A Waterfront"
2. Click "Get Directions"
3. Show the interactive map with route line
4. Point out distance, time, and traffic conditions

**Script**:
> "The Route Planner helps users find optimal routes. Let me demonstrate by planning a route from Cape Town Airport to the V&A Waterfront. The system shows the route on an interactive map, provides distance and estimated travel time, and indicates current traffic conditions. This helps commuters choose the best routes in real-time."

### **3. Analytics Dashboard (45 seconds)**
**Navigate to**: Analytics tab
**Show**:
- Traffic volume charts
- Peak hour analysis
- Route performance metrics
- Historical trends

**Script**:
> "The Analytics dashboard provides insights for traffic management. We can see traffic volume patterns, identify peak congestion times, and analyze route performance over time. This data helps city planners understand traffic flows and make informed infrastructure decisions."

### **4. ML Predictions (45 seconds)**
**Navigate to**: Predictions tab  
**Show**:
- 12-hour traffic forecasts
- Multiple Cape Town road segments
- Confidence scores and risk levels
- Real-time updates

**Script**:
> "Our machine learning system predicts traffic conditions up to 12 hours ahead for key Cape Town routes. Each prediction includes confidence scores and risk levels, helping commuters plan their journeys and city officials prepare for potential congestion hotspots."

### **5. Real-time Monitoring (30 seconds)**
**Navigate to**: Real-time Data tab
**Show**:
- Live traffic sensors
- System metrics
- Data stream status
- Auto-refreshing data

**Script**:
> "The Real-time Data tab shows live monitoring of traffic sensors across the city, system health metrics, and data processing streams. This ensures the platform operates reliably with up-to-date information."

### **Conclusion (20 seconds)**
**Script**:
> "This Traffic Optimization Engine demonstrates how modern technology can address Cape Town's traffic challenges through real-time monitoring, intelligent routing, predictive analytics, and data-driven insights - creating a smarter, more efficient transportation system for the city."
